During the first fermentation of kombucha, the SCOBY (Symbiotic Culture of Bacteria and Yeast) transforms the sweetened tea into a tangy and fizzy beverage. The SCOBY consumes the sugars in the tea and produces various beneficial acids, vitamins, and enzymes. This fermentation process typically takes around 7-14 days, depending on the desired taste and temperature. As the fermentation progresses, you may notice the formation of a new SCOBY layer on top of the liquid, which can be used for future brews. It is important to maintain proper hygiene and temperature conditions during the first fermentation to ensure a successful and delicious batch of kombucha.

## What You’ll Need

1-gallon glass vessel
Tightly woven cloth to keep bugs and debris out of your brew
Rubber band
Large pot for boiling water or an electric tea kettle

## Ingredients

10 cups cool water
4 cups boiling water
1 cup sugar
8 black tea bags
2 cups starter liquid
1 pellicle

## Directions

Boil 4 cups of water, remove from heat, and then stir in 1 cup of sugar until dissolved. Add your tea bags and let steep for at least twenty minutes.
Once steeped, add the hot sweet tea to 10 cups cool water to bring it down to a safe temperature for your SCOBY.
Wish clean hands, remove the pellicle from your jar, and place it on a clean plate. Reserve 2 cups of your liquid to start the next batch.
In your large glass jar, add your reserved starter, your batch of cooled sweet tea, and then your pellicle back on top.
Cover with tightly women cloth, secured with a rubber band for 6-10 days. Try if after about six days.
Move on to the second fermentation.
