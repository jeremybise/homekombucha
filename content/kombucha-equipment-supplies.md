Build your own kombucha homebrewing starter kit with these items. Here are what I recommend for brewing kombucha at home.

## [Large Glass Jar](https://amzn.to/3SBddRx) or [Large Jar with Spigot]()

This will be your primary F1 fermentation vessel. You want a good, food-safe glass jar. You don't really need the lids because kombucha needs to be exposed to oxygen in the first fermentation.

## [Tea Towels](https://amzn.to/48Qp3Ng)

This tightly-woven cloth will keep debris and bugs out of your precious brew. Secure with a rubber band.

To help secure your tightly-woven cloth to the brewing vessel.

## [Glass Fermentation Bottles](https://amzn.to/49dYQI3)

These flip-top fermentation bottles are perfect for your second fermentation (F2). 

## [Small Funnel]()

To help get fruit, purees, and kombucha into your fermentation bottles.

## [Blender]()

Optional, but useful for turning fruit into purees for second fermentation (F2).

## [Fine-Mesh Strainer]()

Optional, but I use one to strain my kombucha into serving glasses to get rid of fibrous bits of fruit.

## [Black Tea]()

...

## [Unflavored Kombucha]()

Blah.

## [Starter SCOBY]()

...

## [Sugar]()

Blah.
