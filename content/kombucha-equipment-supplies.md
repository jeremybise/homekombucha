Build your own kombucha homebrewing starter kit with these items. Here are what I recommend for brewing kombucha at home.

## [Large Glass Jar](https://amzn.to/3SBddRx) or [Large Jar with Spigot](https://amzn.to/3SoP8w2)

This will be your primary F1 fermentation vessel. You want a good, food-safe glass jar. You don't really need the lids because kombucha needs to be exposed to oxygen in the first fermentation.

## [Tea Towels](https://amzn.to/48Qp3Ng)

This tightly-woven cloth will keep debris and bugs out of your precious brew. Secure with a rubber band.

## [Glass Fermentation Bottles](https://amzn.to/49dYQI3)

These flip-top fermentation bottles are perfect for your second fermentation (F2). 

## [Small Funnel](https://amzn.to/3u2PekP)

To help get fruit, purees, and kombucha into your fermentation bottles.

## [Blender](https://amzn.to/488TQnv)

Optional, but useful for turning fruit into purees for second fermentation (F2).

## [Fine-Mesh Strainer](https://amzn.to/4bbHRbp)

Optional, but I use one to strain my kombucha into serving glasses to get rid of fibrous bits of fruit.
